Create a To-Do list application. Do the tasks in the order presented. Do not jump ahead before completing a task. It is easy to get overwhelmed by the big picture, and as programmers we want to break complex problems down into small chunks.

Create a single component for all of the following functionality: 

As a user, I will be able to create a To-Do and have it automatically populate a list on creation. A To-Do should be an object with at least two properties: name and a priority. For priority choose your own leveling scheme - it could be “high”, “medium”, or “low”, or on a scale of 1-5, etc.

As a user, I will be able to mark a to-do as completed. There should be a visual indication of completion. 

As a user, I will be able to unmark a to-do as completed. 

As a user, I should be able to view my To-Dos in order of priority. For instance, if I create a high-priority To-Do, it should show up near the top of my list that already exists. There should be a visual indication of higher vs lower priorities, like different colors or larger font. 

If you complete this application, delete it and do it again. 

Then, try to break it out into three components: A NewToDo component, a ToDos component, and a CompletedToDos component. This part should prove to be more difficult than the previous tasks, so if don’t get anywhere with it, instead:

Implement a way to search through To Dos.
